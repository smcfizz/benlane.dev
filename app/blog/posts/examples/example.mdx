## Example Article

Here is an example program listing.

```c++
#include <iostream>

void main() {
    cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
}
```

We can create internal links like so: [projects](/projects).

Compared to an [external link](https://google.com/).

*Notice how internal links redirect the current tab, while external links open in a new tab.*

MDX also has support for JSX, so it can directly render entire components! Here's a small example:

<h1>Heading!</h1>

<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is a lovely language.

<section>
    And here is *markdown* in **JSX**!
</section>

*Notice the difference between the first heading on this page and the one above with respect to URI fragments.*

We can also import our custom components and render them directly in our MDX files.

Here is our list of blog posts from our [blogs](/blogs) page:
<BlogPosts/>

And here is a custom `Table` component:
<Table
    data={{
        headers: ['Header One', 'Header Two', 'Header Three'],
        rows: [
            ['Value 1', 'Value 2', 'Value 3'],
            ['Value 4', 'Value 5', 'Value 6'],
            ['Value 7', 'Value 8', 'Value 9'],
        ],
    }}
/>

*Just be sure that any custom components you want to use are imported in the <b>JSX</b> file that you will be using to render the MDX!*

## More fun

Additionally, MDX also supports JavaScript [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE)s like so:

```javascript
{(function () {
  const guess = Math.random()

  if (guess > 0.66) {
    return <span style={{color: 'tomato'}}>Look at us.</span>
  }

  if (guess > 0.33) {
    return <span style={{color: 'violet'}}>Who would have guessed?!</span>
  }

  return <span style={{color: 'goldenrod'}}>Not me.</span>
})()}
```

Which results in the following:

{(function () {
const guess = Math.random()

if (guess > 0.66) {
return <span style={{color: 'tomato'}}>Look at us.</span>
}

if (guess > 0.33) {
return <span style={{color: 'violet'}}>Who would have guessed?!</span>
}

return <span style={{color: 'goldenrod'}}>Not me.</span>
})()}

There are tons more cool things that can be done with MDX. You can find more [here](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/)!
